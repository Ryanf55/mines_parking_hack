Theory of operation
1. Establish where spots are by drawing lines. Detect spots by any 4 corner closed polygon. Save this to a file that can be applied to any image along with the source image that can be transformed to the original coordinates

  * spot1
    * <corner1x,corner1y>
    * <corner2x,corner2y>
    * <corner3x,corner3y>
    * <corner4x,corner4y>
  * spot2
    * <corner1x,corner1y>
    * <corner2x,corner2y>
    * <corner3x,corner3y>
    * <corner4x,corner4y>
    
2. Any closed polygon will be a mask spot. Count the number of masks to get number of spots

3. Compare two images by subtracing them and absolute valuing the difference. Any difference can be assumed a car leaves or enters. Compare the spot to close area adjacent to it to see if its a spot or not?

4. Establish an output image of green/red depending if is occupied

5. Upload to sql database and create online stats of where spots are. Could be live projected normal image?
